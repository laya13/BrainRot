# BrainRot
PDF to Brainrot Converter

Description: This program allows users to upload any PDF and generates a "brain rot" video.

The PDF is first scraped and then fed into a model which turns the text into a simplified version with slang. The new text is then converted into a video, with text appearing one at a time, along with audio and a Subway Surfers video in the background.

Before running, make sure to pip install PyPDF2 and pyttsx3
